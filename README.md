## Battlefield 1942 client patches
This mod provides several improvements to Battlefield 1942.

### Installation
Copy `d3d8.dll` into your game directory.

If you already have a `d3d8.dll` rename it to `d3d8_next.dll`, it will keep working!

### Updater
The DLL has a builtin updater, so it can replace itself with newer versions. For now the updater cannot be disabled but this option will be added when configuration will be possible.

### Bugfixes
- Fix crash when the game is minimized
- Fix ping display in scoreboard
- Fix other windows getting resized when the game is launched
- Fix maplist sometimes empty

### Enhancements
- Speed up reconnecting to servers on map change
